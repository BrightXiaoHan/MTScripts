But the above understanding is open to question. First of all, it is confused for us to adopt the above understanding. Mr. Guo also believes that people will fail to communicate with the gods and achieve the purpose of making the gods enjoy the sacrifice and obtain the protection of the gods without clean body and pure spirit. However, the bottom of the shoes is dirty, and entering the ancestral temple with shoes will pollute the place; the weapons carried into the ancestral temple will make the ancestral gods uneasy. When Cao Cao went into the hall with a sword and shoes, Mr. Guo also thought it was disrespectful to his ancestors. In my opinion, it was blasphemous. However, Mr. Guo held that except entering the temple with sword and shoes, Cao Cao showed his respect to the gods later. So does Cao Cao blaspheme or respect for gods? Secondly, the understanding is not in line with common sense. "Entering the hall with sword and shoes is a special courtesy in a special occasion, not a requirement that must be implemented at any time and place. Cao Cao can use "the hall was not for true person" as an excuse to maintain respect for his ancestors and gods. There is no reason to desecrate his ancestors and gods rather than making adaptation. Thirdly, Mr. Guo's understanding does not conform to the historical reality. Cao Cao, a special ruler, was the emperor without the title. In the 19th year of Jian'an, The Fu, the empress of Emperor Xian of Han, was executed by Cao Cao for writing a letter to her father to express hatred for Cao Cao's killing Dong Cheng. It is recorded that.
